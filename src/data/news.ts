            "First there was Clippy. Now Microsoft Copilot has a face, with reactions to what you tell it.",
            `Microsoft is showing off how Copilot could “look”: as an anthropomorphic teardrop of sorts, with expressions that react to your interactions in real time. The discovery was reported Friday by The Verge.`,
            `Right now, the new look of Copilot is being presented to a limited number of users. Microsoft’s web page shows how to discover if you have it: by opening Copilot, clicking the “mic” icon to launch verbal interactions with Copilot, then clicking the “gear,” or settings, icon. That will open up the options to toggle the “appearance” off or on.`,
            `“What if you could see Copilot react and speak as you chat?” Microsoft says. “With this experiment, we are bringing more non-verbal communication to Copilot, enhancing voice conversations with real-time visual expression. This early prototype allows you to chat, brainstorm, seek advice, or just mess around with Copilot, in a more engaging and expressive way.”`,
            `Right now, the new Copilot appearance option is just being offered to consumers, and not people who subscribe to a Microsoft 365 business plan.`,
            `Microsoft has tended to try and give its assistants a friendlier face, from the Office Assistant (which included Clippit/Clippy) as well as Microsoft Bob and its coterie of animated assistants. That didn’t go so well, however, when Microsoft launched and cancelled Microsoft Tay, its assistant who was quickly corrupted by internet trolls. Anthropomorphic mascots have also become a staple in some cultures, such as Japan.`,
            `Copilot already leans pretty heavily on emojis to communicate how it “feels.” Ironically, when Bing Search / Copilot was launched, it was pretty personable — probably too much. Now, it’s much more bland.`,
            `Will users clamor for a Clippy option? Why not? If you have opinions, let us know on our Facebook page or on Bluesky. We can promise that our PCWorld logo will remain just the static image it is.`,

            `In a recent Windows IT Pro blog post, Microsoft commented on the latest innovations in Windows 11, sparked by the optional July update (KB5062660) that brought several new features to Windows 11 24H2.`,
            `Some of the biggest improvements in update KB5062660 include Windows Recall for EU users, replacing the Blue Screen of Death, and a new feature called Quick Machine Recovery that helps repair Windows PCs that can’t boot in case of a widespread issue.`,
            `However, according to Microsoft, Windows 11 24H2 is much more than all of this, claiming that Windows 11 24H2 is “[the] most reliable version of Windows yet” while taking a subtle jab at Windows 10, surely hoping to convince Windows 10 holdouts to make the upgrade. Here’s what Microsoft has to say about it: "We’re also proud to share that Windows 11 24H2 is our most reliable version of Windows yet. Compared to Windows 10 22H2, failure rates for unexpected restarts have dropped by 24%."`,
            `The above statement cites “reliability telemetry collected by Microsoft,” which calls its veracity into question. Microsoft collects a lot of telemetry data, but it doesn’t know everything—especially when it comes to older versions of Windows prior to aggressive telemetry. For example, a comparison of Windows 11 to Windows 2000, NT, or XP isn’t possible.`,
            `It’s easy to see why Microsoft is only comparing Windows 11 with Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing Windows 11 for a while now, and even though Windows 11 market share is increasing, Windows 10 users are either reluctant to make the switch or simply can’t upgrade due to Windows 11’s strict requirements.`,
            `So, sure, maybe Windows 11 24H2 actually is the “most reliable” Windows version of all time. Or maybe it isn’t. Who can really say? Given that Windows 11 24H2 has broken all kinds of stuff—including USB printers, audio output, Bluetooth connections, Windows Update, and Windows Firewall as recently as this month—we can’t fault anyone for being skeptical of Microsoft’s claim here.`,

            `If you’re old enough to remember the original, brick-like Game Boy, you’ll want to check out LEGO’s newest play for adult brickheads. The officially licensed Game Boy building set comes with 421 pieces, including two cartridges for Zelda and Mario games. While you can’t actually play them, you can swap out the simulated screens to match.`,
            `At 5.5 x 3.5 inches (14 x 9 centimeters, for those who live in civilized countries), the set is a near-perfect match for the original handheld from 1989, though the real thing is ever-so-slightly taller. The set includes a display stand for both the main body itself and the Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Super Mario Land cartridges. You get a choice of three swappable screens with lenticular black-and-white screenshots of the games or the boot screen, which simulate a bit of screen motion based on how you look at them.`,
            `Check out the serial number on the back of the battery bay. The Game Boy was first released in Japan on April 21st, 1989.`,
            `Considering that it’s a relatively small set, it’s impressive how faithfully the original hardware has been reproduced — even the slanted Start and Select buttons are accounted for with some clever use of ramped pieces. And at $60, it’s surprisingly cheap for a licensed Nintendo set. The far larger and more complex LEGO Nintendo Entertainment System, over 2500 pieces, cost $230 when it debuted in 2020.`,
            `LEGO is currently making a big play for nostalgia sets for adult builders. In addition to the Game Boy and NES, there’s an officially licensed Atari 2600, a Pac-Man arcade cabinet, and 80s cartoon staples like Transformers and Voltron. The new Game Boy set is up for pre-order now, shipping in October.`
